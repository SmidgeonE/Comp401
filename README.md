# Boid Simulation

This is a C++ project using OpenMP and MPI to perform a multi-threaded N-Body simulation, with the choice of using it on a supercomputer of interconnected compute nodes.

# Setup

First git clone it to your area. The actual simulation source and header files are in the programFiles folder. 

I have provided bash scripts to make compilation easy.
